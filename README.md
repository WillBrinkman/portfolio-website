Will Brinkman's Portfolio
Hello! I'm Will Brinkman from St. Louis. I've always had an interest building things, and I'm particularly passionate about playing with computers.

This portfolio is a culmination of my passion, my work, and my vision. It's designed to:

•Showcase the projects I've worked on.
•Provide insights into my professional journey.
•Serve as a platform for potential opportunities and collaborations.

Tech Stack
This website is built using a combination of powerful technologies:

•React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
•Next.js: A React framework with hybrid static & server rendering, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
•TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Features

•Project Gallery: A curated showcase of my most significant and impactful projects.
•Contact: A way to get in touch and collaborate.

Future Plans
While the current version of the website paints a comprehensive picture, I'm always looking forward to enhancements. I plan on:

•Introducing a blog section to share my thoughts, discoveries, and experiences.
•Integrating more interactive elements to engage visitors.
•Expanding the gallery with more projects and detailed case studies.
